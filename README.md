# gmaps-image

Download images from Google Maps using Python and Maps Static API.

Before using the script, obtain a API key for Google Maps Static API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/overview). This key is to be used in the script.
A URL corresponding to the coordinates of location of interest is created. The URL is then used to download the image using imutils and OpenCV packages. 

Refer https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start to know about the map parameters to use construct the URL.
